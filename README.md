# Carbon Data Visualisation

A simple example of data visualisation in React. The app uses the national grid API to obtain carbon data and displays this in a pie chart. 

From the site you can pick a 40 day range and either England,Scotland or Wales to see data for that region. The carbon data is processed from 30 minute ranges and provides accurate government data. The national grid provides assumed data for the next two days, the calendar allows a date range 2 days from the current day.

The app was built as a mobile orientated app but also works on a computer browser.
